If you are managing more several machines which fall into identifiable groups (say, workstations and servers) and the settings for each machine in a specific group are the same, you can place group-specific settings in this folder. For each group, create a .yml file with the group name (the same name as in the inventory.yml file), and add the variables to the files. These will override settings in the roles' local variable files.
