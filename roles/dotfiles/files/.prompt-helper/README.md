# prompt-helper
Prompt helper displays the current ruby version and git status in the command prompt. Git status includes: whether the currect directory is part of a local git repo or not, whether the local repo is clean or dirty, how many commits it is ahead or behind the remote git server.

Brazenly borrowed from bash-it to make a stripped down and streamlined helper that only provides the advanced prompt without all the other bash-it functionality (and weight).
